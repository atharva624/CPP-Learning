# Array and String

## 1. Problem Definition:
The program involves managing student records with two main tasks:
1. Adding new students and storing their details (name, age, and grades).
2. Calculating the average grade for each student and counting how many students exceed a specified average grade threshold.

It requires handling input/output, utilizing structures and arrays, and implementing functions for modular code.

## 2. Solution:
1. **Student Structure:** A `Student` structure is defined to hold the student's name, age, and an array of grades.
2. **Adding Students:** The `addStudent` function allows for adding new student records into an array.
3. **Average Grade Calculation:** The `calculateAverage` function computes the average of the grades for each student.
4. **Displaying Information:** The `displayStudents` function shows all students along with their calculated average grades.
5. **Counting Students Above Threshold:** The `countAboveThreshold` function uses recursion to count how many students have an average grade exceeding a given threshold.

## 3. Learning:
- **Structures:** Demonstrates the use of structures to organize related data efficiently.
- **Arrays and Pointers:** Utilizes an array of structures and pointer manipulation to manage multiple records.
- **Functions:** Implements various functions for code modularity and reusability.
- **Input/Output Handling:** Shows how to handle user input with `cin` and output with `cout`.
- **Recursion:** Provides an example of using recursion to solve a counting problem.
