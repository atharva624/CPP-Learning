# Product Management System

## 1. Problem Definition:
The program involves managing a product list with two main tasks:
1. Adding new products and storing their details (name and price).
2. Sorting the products by price and displaying them.

It requires handling input/output, utilizing classes and arrays, and implementing functions for modular code.

## 2. Solution:
1. **Product Class:** A `Product` class is defined to hold the product's name and price.
2. **Adding Products:** The `addProduct` function allows for adding new product records into an array.
3. **Sorting by Price:** The `sortByPrice` function uses bubble sort to arrange products by price in ascending order.
4. **Displaying Information:** The `displayProducts` function shows all products along with their prices.

## 3. Learning:
- **Classes and Objects:** Demonstrates the use of classes to organize related data efficiently.
- **Arrays and Vectors:** Utilizes an array of objects and vector manipulation to manage multiple records.
- **Functions:** Implements various functions for code modularity and reusability.
- **Input/Output Handling:** Shows how to handle user input with `cin` and output with `cout`.
- **Sorting Algorithm:** Provides an example of using bubble sort to sort objects based on their attributes.
