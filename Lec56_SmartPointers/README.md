# Lambda Function Calculator

## Problem Definition
This project implements a `Calculator` class that allows users to store and execute operations defined by lambda functions. The operations can capture variables by reference or by value and can utilize mutable captures to change captured variables.

## Solution
The solution includes the creation of a `Calculator` class that manages a collection of lambda functions. Users can add operations and execute them with input values.

## Approach
1. Define a `Calculator` class that stores a vector of lambda functions.
2. Implement a method to add new operations.
3. Implement a method to execute all stored operations with a given input.
4. Demonstrate variable captures by value and by reference, along with mutable captures.
